DNG Test Utils
====================

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to reduce boiler plate in Angular test code.
Specifically regarding mocking dependencies and working with promises.

This library is still a work in progress, but feel free to look around.
There will most likely be forced pushes at this point so be warned!
